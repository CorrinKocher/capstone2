This was the second application I created with a pair programmer (while completed the .NET bootcamp at TechElevator). 
It was a great way to to practice writing SQL statements, and creating menus. 
The objective was to take in reservations through the User Interface, check the availability of that time/location, 
complete the reservation and update the database with the new reservation.
